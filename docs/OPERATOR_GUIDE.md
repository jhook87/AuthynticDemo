# Operator Walkthrough

## 1. Dashboard
- Monitor consensus algorithm rotation, leader node, commit rate, and finality.
- Review live alerts and recent incidents; respond to critical items first.
- Inspect system health metrics (uptime, latency) and ensure thresholds remain green.

## 2. Network Operations
- Canvas visualization displays each node by role; connections animate the consortium topology.
- Consensus metadata highlights the active protocol and leader election results.
- Use simulated partition events (triggered automatically) to observe how nodes recover after network disruptions.

## 3. Media Authenticity Pipeline
- Select from the sample image, audio, or video asset.
- Examine SHA-256 / SHA-3 / BLAKE2b hashes, fingerprint, Merkle batch verification, and blockchain anchoring summary.
- Watermark strength, moderation risk, and ZKP confidence guide escalation decisions.

## 4. Analytics Center
- Trust projections estimate future scores based on historical trend data.
- Performance benchmarks compare current throughput/latency to baseline and target objectives.
- Fraud patterns display anomaly signatures and confidence for potential attacks.

## 5. Operations & Configuration
- Track open incident tasks and SLA status.
- Verify integrations (SSO, APIs, webhooks) and last synchronization timestamps.
- Review disaster recovery plans (RTO/RPO) and upcoming upgrade windows.

## Incident Response Flow
1. Identify alert severity from the Dashboard.
2. Drill into Network or Media modules to validate authenticity signals.
3. Update tasks or mitigation steps in Operations.
4. Use Analytics to confirm trust posture returns to acceptable ranges.

## Training & Simulation
- Tutorial overlay highlights key modules for first-time operators.
- Real-time simulation hook (`useRealtimeSimulation`) continuously feeds latency shifts, consensus changes, and synthetic incidents to rehearse response workflows.
