# Authyntic Platform Demo

ðŸŽ¬ **[LIVE DEMO](https://authyntic-demo.netlify.app)**

Welcome to the Authyntic platform demo! This project provides an interactive,
browserâ€‘based demonstration of the Authyntic media provenance and
authenticity platform. It showcases how trust is established on a
distributed network, how streaming media can be cryptographically
verified in realâ€‘time and how users can explore Merkle proofs under the
hood.

## What is Authyntic?

Authyntic is a media provenance and authenticity platform designed to
authenticate streaming and uploaded media at the edge and in the cloud.
It combines cryptographic techniques like Merkle trees with
peerâ€‘toâ€‘peer coordination and dynamic trust scoring to provide a robust
chain of custody for audio, video and imagery. This demo uses
lightweight mock services and hardâ€‘coded data to illustrate the core
concepts without requiring any backâ€‘end infrastructure.

## Demo Features

- âœ… **Realâ€‘time trust network visualization** â€“ explore how edge devices
  and coordinators connect and exchange trust signals via an interactive
  forceâ€‘directed graph.
- âœ… **Interactive Merkle proof validation** â€“ inspect Merkle tree
  structures, calculate custom trust scores and validate proofs step by
  step.
- âœ… **Streaming media authentication** â€“ play audio and video while
  generating cryptographic proofs and simulating tamper detection.
- âœ… **Edge device network mapping** â€“ click on nodes to reveal
  metadata, status and trust scores.
- âœ… **Tamper detection simulation** â€“ toggle tampering on generated
  hashes to see how verification fails.

## Technology Stack

This project uses a modern frontâ€‘end stack to deliver smooth
visualizations and responsive interactions:

- **React + TypeScript** â€“ componentâ€‘based UI development with strong
  typing.
- **D3.js** â€“ dynamic data visualizations for the network map and Merkle
  tree displays.
- **Vite** â€“ fast development server and optimized build pipeline.
- **Recharts** â€“ (included for future use) charting library for data
  metrics.
- **Cryptoâ€‘JS** â€“ hashing library used to simulate Merkle tree and
  cryptographic proofs.

## Installation & Development

To run the demo locally you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AuthynticDemo.git
cd AuthynticDemo
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the demo in your
browser at `http://localhost:3000`. For a production build, run
`npm run build` which will output a `dist` directory containing static
assets.

## Deployment

The demo is configured for deployment to Netlify. The included
`deploy/netlify.toml` file defines the publish directory and catchâ€‘all
redirect so that clientâ€‘side routing works correctly. To deploy you can
run:

```bash
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
```

Alternatively you can connect the GitHub repository to Netlify and
enable continuous deployment.

## Demo Walkthrough

1. **Dashboard** â€“ view realâ€‘time metrics, including the number of
   active streams, trust scores and valid proofs. A table lists
   current media streams and their authenticity percentages. A small
   network preview offers a quick glance at device connectivity.
2. **Trust Visualization** â€“ dive into the Merkle tree structures
   behind proofs. Adjust reliability and risk factors with sliders to
   observe how trust scores change. Validate sample proofs and see a
   consensus indicator based on network trust scores.
3. **Streaming Demo** â€“ play sample audio and video. Generate a
   cryptographic proof for a selected stream and simulate tampering to
   witness how verification responds.
4. **Network Map** â€“ explore a fully interactive forceâ€‘directed graph
   representing the trust network. Drag nodes around and click on them
   to view details such as status and trust score.
5. **Media Auth** â€“ upload your own images, videos or audio files to
   simulate authenticity scoring. A random hash and confidence score
   based on the file contents are displayed along with a colored
   progress bar.
6. **Proof Generator** â€“ experiment with arbitrary leaf values. Enter
   commaâ€‘separated strings, generate the corresponding Merkle tree,
   compute a proof for a selected leaf and verify its correctness.
